 A weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This app allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecast for their desired location. I utilized APIs to gather real-time weather data and display it in an interactive and user-friendly interface. The design is visually appealing with a clean layout, and the app is responsive for optimal viewing on various devices.
